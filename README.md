## Introduction
This is an open source app to remember **birthdays** in a fast, light and beautiful way. No less, no more. I had this idea considering that Google Calendar doesn't display an automatic notification the day of the birthday, and sometimes i need to remember a birthday for a person who is not in my Google Contacts. Also, adding to much birthdays to the calendar make it messy and i prefer to manage them separately.

## Features
- Notification the day of the event, in a customizable time range
- Additional notification up to 7 days before the event
- Sync the existing birthdays from Google Contacts
- Easily backup and restore your saved birthdays!
- insert a birthday manually, just specifying a name, an optional surname and a date
- Choose your favorite birthdays to see detailed informations about them
- Long press on a birthday to see every possible detail
- The birthdays are also automagically backed up in cloud by Google Play Services when the app is installed from Play Store
- A huge set of randomly generated stats (zodiac, average age and a lot more) when more than 5 birthdays are inserted
- Easily delete and modify the birthdays
- Quick apps launcher
- Light and dark themes (Android 10 dark mode supported)
- Selectable accent (no app restart needed)
- Beautiful animations
- Multiwindow support
- Splashscreen and app intro

## Credits and contributions
Currently, Birday supports english, spanish and italian. If you want to translate the app in any other language, just contact me: you'll be quoted both on Github and in the Play Store description.
This app was written during my free time as a training. Many good devs have helped me understanding the best practices and they taught me a lot of useful tricks. **Every translation is well appreciated!**
