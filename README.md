## Introduction
This is an open source app to remember **birthdays** in a fast, light and beautiful way. No less, no more. I had this idea considering that Google Calendar doesn't display an automatic notification the day of the birthday, and sometimes i need to remember a birthday for a person who is not in my phone contacts. 

## Features (and TODO list)
- Notification the day of the birthday
- Sync the birthdays from your Google contacts or insert them manually, just specifying a name, a date and some optional parameters
- Customize behaviour and appearence of each person in the list
- Light and dark themes (Android 10 dark mode supported)
- Selectable accent (no app restart needed)
- Multiwindow support
- More soon!

The app will be available through Google Play\
