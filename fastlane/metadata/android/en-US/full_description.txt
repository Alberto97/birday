Please note: the notification system relies on the Android OS resources, thus some manufacturers may cause malfunctions. The reason is that some Xiaomi, Huawei and Oneplus devices kill the apps instead of simply closing it, or block the automatic startup of the app process. I can't fix this, but you can find more informations on dontkillmyapp.com.
